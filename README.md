We need to create a simple app with information about Formula 1 Championship since 2018 to 2022. The information about it will be provided by
[Formula One API  by Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd). 

You'll be a able to find a good explanation about [how the Ergast F1 API works here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11586746/SztEa7bL#intro)

- Use pagination by default with results 10 items per page.
- Add number to items to show in pagination:
  - 10
  - 15
  - 25
